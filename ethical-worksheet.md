# Write a one-paragraph story describing a fictional person who was positively affected by a model trained with these data.

Chad would be positively affected by this study as he owns an eco friendly oil company. Chad’s company is called Ecoil. Ecoil’s policy is focused around retrieving and distributing oil with a minimal impact on the Earth and its ecosystems. Ecoil would gain major positive publicity when the study shows that their oil rigs have no recorded oil spills. With more positive publicity more stockholders would take part in Ecoil resulting with more funding making Ecoil the most profitable oil company. 

# Write a one-paragraph story describing a fictional person who was negatively affected by a model trained with these data.

Brad would be negatively affected by this study as he owns an oil company that has taken many shortcuts to reach the top of the oil industry. Brad’s company is called Boil. Boil’s policy is set to make as much money as possible as fast as possible. With this in mind Boil has not taken all the necessary procedures and steps to keep their oil rigs as safe and spill resistant as possible. Boil would have major negative publicity as their company secrets would be exposed with the reveal of poi having the largest amount of oil spills. This will cause Boil’s stocks to drop and funding to cease resulting in poi going out of business.

# Describe at least two sources of bias the particular model in your story could have.

One source of bias that could be found in the model in our story is who collected the data. If a close friend of Chad’s or someone from his company collected the data they could have done it in a way that would favor his friend. A second source of bias is when the data was collected. If the data happened to be collected when Brad’s company had an abnormal amount of spills it would create the image of Brad being more irresponsible than he may be in actuality. This would cause a larger difference between Chad’s company and Brad’s company making Chad’s company look better.

# Describe at least one way we could modify the model to mitigate this bias. E.g. What can we do when designing our model to account for inherent bias in the input data?

One way to mitigate the bias in the model is to actively work against a bias in the data. If the data is purposefully skewed to the left we could design the model to pull to the right to make up for the bias to the left. Another way to work against the bias would be to edit the data before the model is built. If there is an abnormal amount of data coming from one source versus the rest some parts could be opted out if they go against the overall trend to keep it from skewing the data in any way.


# Describe at least one way we could modify the dataset to mitigate this bias. E.g. What could we do differently if we collected these data again? 

The dataset could be modified to mitigate bias by removing outliers. Data that could be classified as an outlier would cause the data to not be as accurate by pulling the results to one side or the other. By removing these outliers it will allow for the data to all be analyzed at an equal level.

# Describe at least one way we could modify the context surrounding the model to mitigate this bias. E.g. What human practices or policies could we put in place to protect people within the social system where this model is used? 

The context could be modified to mitigate bias by keeping the context factual only. An example would be using the environmental context. If there is no mention of the impact that oil spills have on the environment it would seem biased in the oil companies favors. If there is too much mention of the environmental effects or all the information is not verified facts it will seem to be biased in the anti-oil environmentalists favors. Keeping the context neutral with only facts would mitigate the bias.
