## Description

Oil spills are a well-known issue and hazard to the ecosystem. They create hazardous environments for the wildlife within the area of the spill. An example of this would be the Deepwater Horizon incident. This lasted from April of 2010 to September 2010. Oil spills like Deepwater Horizon are what lead companies like Procter & Gamble, the creators of Dawn dish soap to campaign for animal rescue and clean up.The goal of this project is to use machine learning and some of the lessons learned from this summer's boot camp to create a model to help detect the occurrence of an oil spill. The model will use certain parameters that will be tuned and adjusted to help increase the accuracy of prediction. We hope that in the future there is an even more accurate classifier to eliminate the threat of an oil spill relatively, if not completely, eradicated.
