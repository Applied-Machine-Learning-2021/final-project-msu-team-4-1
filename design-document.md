# Capstone Project: Oil Spills

---

# Objective
**Give a brief description of the goals of your project.**
 
To be able to predict when oil spills happen and how often they occur in different areas 

<!--
What questions do you hope to address? What value will you be adding to the space? 
-->

Questions we hope to address are the frequency of oil spills, do they generally happen during a certain time of year

---

# Background
**Describe the background and context for this project.** 


<!--
What is the motivation for studying this topic? What other work has been done: what was good and where does it fall short? If your project is interdisciplinary, give an overview of the key ideas from the connecting disciplines. 
-->
The motivation for studying this topic is to help stop oil spills from happening. This study has a focus on where oil spills have or have not occurred. By mapping out where the oil spills have previously happened and at what frequency they occur it will be the first step in preventing future spills.

# Data Collection
**Describe your preliminary ideas for data collection and cleaning.** 

By using various different charts and graphs we will be able to show they data in collections and be able to clean them up 

<!--
Are you planning to use datasets that are already compiled? Will you need to pull supplemental information from additional sources? What plans do you have to clean and prepare your data? How much time are you budgeting for the data collection and cleaning process? 

*Note* Students frequently underestimate this step. It is important to remind them that sometimes 90 percent of this work is getting the data in a usable format.

# Detail Design/Ideas
**Provide a detailed overview of the project design. 
The details and the ideas that we have for our project is just being able to fully show all the details that are in our data set. Which includes making sure that we show many details about oil spills**


<!--
How will you approach the problem? What ideas/experiments do you have planned? 

Tips:
* Focus on design, not implementation.
* A picture is worth a thousand words. A diagram or drawing of the data and model at times is much easier to understand than words.
* If describing alternatives (e.g., approach, platform, algorithm), explain why it’s not part of your design.
* If you take a different approach than originally designed, come back and update your design docs.

# Project Plan 
**Provide a project plan that includes a list of intermediate goals, milestones, and timelines. Also include the schedule of when different team members will take on the program manager and note taker roles.** 

<!--
You will update this project plan throughout the project. It will be a guide that keeps you on track and accountable. It may be helpful to think about the project management session as you create your plan.

- Step 1: Find Target Column- Jabari
- Step 2: Deal with missing observations- Edwin
- Step 3: Drop columns that contain uninformative data- Edwin
- Step 4: Delete rows with duplicate data- Nyrel
- Step 5: Delete rows with no associated target- Jabari/Latrell
- Step 6: Correct any misspellings of the target label- Nyrel
- Step 7: Build and test classifiers- Latrell

# Fairness Considerations
Complete the ethical storyboarding activity. 

<!--
You will also complete this again as part of your final project, as it is critical to consider ethical implications early and often throughout any project. 

The ethical storyboarding worksheet asks your group to:
* describe a fictional person who was positively affected by a model trained with these data
Chad would be positively affected by this study as he owns an eco friendly oil company. Chad’s company is called Ecoil. Ecoil’s policy is focused around retrieving and distributing oil with a minimal impact on the Earth and its ecosystems. Ecoil would gain major positive publicity when the study shows that their oil rigs have no recorded oil spills. With more positive publicity more stockholders would take part in Ecoil resulting with more funding making Ecoil the most profitable oil company. 
* describe a fictional person who was negatively affected by a model trained with these data
Brad would be negatively affected by this study as he owns an oil company that has taken many shortcuts to reach the top of the oil industry. Brad’s company is called Boil. Boil’s policy is set to make as much money as possible as fast as possible. With this in mind Boil has not taken all the necessary procedures and steps to keep their oil rigs as safe and spill resistant as possible. Boil would have major negative publicity as their company secrets would be exposed with the reveal of poi having the largest amount of oil spills. This will cause Boil’s stocks to drop and funding to cease resulting in poi going out of business.
* describe at least two sources of bias the particular model in your story could have
* describe at least one way you could modify the model to mitigate this bias
  * what can you do when designing our model to account for inherent bias in the input data?
* describe at least one way you could modify the dataset to mitigate this bias 
  * what could you do differently if you collected these data again? 
* describe at least one way you could modify the context surrounding the model to mitigate this bias
  * consider what human practices or policies you could put in place to protect people within the social system where this model is used

# References
Provide an annotated list of reference materials that you used in preparing these design documents, as well as any additional references that you plan to use in your project. 

<!--
For each reference provide a 1-2 sentence summary of the content and a brief description of how it was (or will be used).
